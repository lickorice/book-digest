## Notes
 - As CPUs and GPUs expand horizontally (adding more cores), the challenge now is to develop application software that scales with this expansion.
 - CUDA parallel programming model is designed to overcome this challenge of scaling by introducting three key abstractions: a hierarchy of thread groups, shared memories, and barrier synchronization.
 - Talks about layers of abstraction in parallelism.
