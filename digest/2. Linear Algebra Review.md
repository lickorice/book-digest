# 2.1 Scalars, Vectors, Matrices, and Tensors
- Mostly a review, taken up linear algebra in undergrad anyway.
- Discusses scalars, vectors, and **tensors**.
	- **Tensors** are just a fancy way of defining an array with more than two axes, or with a variable number of axes.
- Notes the importance of a matrix transposition operation (why?)
	- Maybe for ease of notation? Or operation

# 2.2 Multiplying Matrices and Vectors
- Again, mostly a review.
- Specifically defines an **element-wise product** or **Hadamard product** as simply multiplying the elements of matrices together. Denoted as ![[Pasted image 20230127004819.png]].

# 2.3 Identity and Inverse Matrices
- Once again, a review.
